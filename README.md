# 🗺️ Dalel App – Travel Guide Portfolio Project


⚠️ Note: This repository is for **portfolio purposes only**.  
Dalel App is a demo project showcasing Flutter UI, Firebase integration, and BLoC state management. It is not intended as a live client application.

This project contains UI code, screenshots, and demo assets for portfolio presentation. It serves as a visual reference of my Flutter development skills.
